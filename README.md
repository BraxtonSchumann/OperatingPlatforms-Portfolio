# Software Design Document: The Gaming Room

## Summary
The client, The Gaming Room, is a company that offers digital games and wanted to expand their existing Android-only game, *Draw It or Lose It*, into a web-based, multi-platform environment. They needed a software design that would allow for multiple teams and players, ensure unique naming, and maintain only one active instance of a game at a time. Their goal was to reach users on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android through both web and mobile interfaces.

## Strengths in the Documentation
I clearly articulated the client’s business and technical requirements and provided a logical, scalable solution that addressed server setup, system architecture, memory and storage management, distributed systems, and security. I ensured that the language was client-friendly yet detailed enough for a development team to follow.

## Helpful Aspects of the Design Process
Working through the design document helped me structure the software into clear components before coding. Defining the system architecture, memory management, and distributed communication made it much easier to foresee potential challenges and plan solutions early.

## Areas for Improvement
If I were to revise any part of the work, I would add more visual diagrams, such as a high-level system architecture diagram, alongside the UML class diagram. This would improve clarity for stakeholders who prefer visual representations of complex systems.

## Interpreting and Implementing User Needs
I interpreted the user's needs by carefully analyzing the game’s rules and functionality requirements and mapping them to technical features such as team management, game state control, and cross-platform support. Considering user needs is critical because software must align with how users expect to interact with it; otherwise, even a technically perfect system may fail to meet its objectives.

## Approach to Designing Software
I approached the design by first breaking down the functional requirements into smaller, manageable services. I used modular design principles and emphasized scalability, security, and maintainability. In the future, I would continue using techniques like user story mapping, API-first design, and microservice architecture to ensure flexibility and strong alignment with client goals.
